#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is about applying engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain software systems. It covers everything from designing and building software to testing, deploying, and keeping it running smoothly.


2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

i) Development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C) - Software Engineering led to the development of programming languages which modern programming languages were coined from.
ii) Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s - in the 1960s software engineering was formalized as a field.
iii) Advent of structured programming in the 1970s - The introduction of structured programming in the 1970s promoted the use of clear, logical code structures
iv) Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s - Agile methodologies emerged in the 2000s as a response to the need for more flexible and iterative approaches to software development.

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

i) Requirement Analysis: Understanding and documenting what the software needs to do.
ii) Design: Planning the architecture and user interfaces based on the requirements.
iii) Implementation (Coding): Writing the actual code to build the software.
iv) Testing: Ensuring the software works as intended and is free of bugs.
v) Deployment: Releasing the software for use.
vi) Maintenance: Ongoing support and updates to the software after deployment.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

i) Waterfall: This is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. It's ideal for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change, like building a bridge.
ii) Agile: This is an iterative and flexible approach where work is done in small, manageable chunks called sprints. It's perfect for projects where requirements might change frequently, like developing a new app based on user feedback.

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

i) Software Developer: They write the code, implement algorithms, and ensure the software functions as expected.
ii) Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: They test the software to find and fix bugs, ensuring the product meets the required standards.
iii) Project Manager: They oversee the project, manage timelines, coordinate the team, and ensure the project meets its goals.

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

i) Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): These are tools that provide a comprehensive environment for writing and testing code. They help developers be more productive by providing features like code completion, debugging, and version control integration. e.g. Visual Studio Code
ii) Version Control Systems (VCS): VCSs help manage changes to code over time. They are crucial for collaboration, as they allow multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other's work. e.g Git

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

i) Managing Complexity: Software can get very complex, making it hard to manage. Strategies like breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable parts or using design patterns can help.
ii) Meeting Deadlines: Balancing time and quality is tough. Agile practices like iterative development can help deliver value regularly while refining the product.
iii) Communication Gaps: Miscommunication can lead to misunderstandings in requirements or progress. Regular meetings and clear documentation can minimize this.

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

i) Unit Testing: Testing individual components or functions. It ensures that each part works correctly in isolation.
ii) Integration Testing: Testing how different components work together. It checks for issues in the interaction between modules.
iii) System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole. It ensures the software works as a complete product.
iv) Acceptance Testing: Testing done to ensure the software meets the business requirements. It's the final step before the software is delivered to the customer.
   


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering involves crafting inputs or "prompts" that are used to interact with AI models effectively. It's important because the quality of the prompt directly impacts the quality of the AI's output. Good prompts lead to more accurate and useful responses from AI models.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

i) Vague Prompt: "Tell me about technology."
ii) Improved Prompt: "Can you explain how blockchain technology works and its impact on financial systems?"
